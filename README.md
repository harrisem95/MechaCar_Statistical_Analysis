## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

### Results
The vehicle_length and ground_clearance provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset because their p-values are less than 0.05. The p-value of this model is 5.35e-11 which is less than 0.05 which indicates that the slope of the linear model is not zero. Multiple R-squared is 0.7149 which indicates that 71.49% of predictions using this model will be correct, which means that this linear model does effectively predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

### Results
When looking at the total_summary table, the variance is 62.29356 which is well below the 100 benchmark. However, looking more deeply at the data grouping the data by lot number, we can see that lot 3 has a variance of 170.2861224 which is significantly higher than the 100 pound variance benchmark and this lot i s causing the largest amount of variance within the data.

### Top Ending Locations

![Table Two](/Resources/Story_2.png) 

The most popular ending locations are similar to the starting locations, but are more evenly spread out throughout NYC.

### Checkout Times for Users

![Table Three](/Resources/Story_3.png) 

Most rides are under 30 minutes. It seems as though people are mostly using the bikes to get from one place to anohter, and not for long bike rides for fun.

### Checkout Times by Gender

![Table Four](/Resources/Story_4.png) 

Men use the citybikes more often and for longer than other genders.

### Trips by Weekday per Hour

![Table Five](/Resources/Story_5.png) 

The most popular times to use the bike during the week are before and after work hours. The weekend times are more evenly spread out. People are most likely using these bikes to commute to and from work which is why these are the most popular times. Without work, the weekends have much more spaced out usage.

### Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour)

![Table Six](/Resources/Story_6.png) 

Men use the bikes more than women before and after work hours during the week.

### User Trips by Gender by Weekday

![Table Seven](/Resources/Story_7.png) 

Men subscribers use the bikes more than women subscribers. The most popular days for men to use the bikes are Thursday and Friday.

## Results

### Conclusions 
The conclusions I draw on this data is that bikesharing is much more popular among men and subscribers. The most popular times to ride bikes are during rush hour and this data leaves me to believe that people are using these bikes to commute to work. From this data, I would recommend that citibike try to market more to women in order to increase their profits and market share. Two other visualizations I would create would be the starting and ending locations by gender to see if there are more popular areas that women like to use the bike. Citibike can use this information to effectively market this group of customers.
